# StalkingDrone
This drone will stalk you into your nightmares.

## The Plan
### OpenCV
We will make a drone that follows people around using it's camera. This is achieved using the open source library [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).
OpenCV means 'Open Computer Vision', Computer vision is a term used to describe a computer reacting to input from a camera. We can use OpenCV to find human figures, faces, shapes and colours. Using this information we can track people and follow them.

### The Drone
The drone will be programmed using the library [DjiTelloPy](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy) with this library we can connect to the drone using wi-fi. From the library we can oder the drone to move, turn, start and stop. Furthermore we can get input from it's camera. We can then use this input together with OpenCV and then tell the drone where to fly via the output from OpenCV.
